			<h3>Evaluation Script</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Greetings to the participants who attended the lab. A brief explanation of the application and its
				    capabilities and constraints. The application available is a prototype so not everything will work.
				    This provides the participants with information on what to expect but without providing a complete
				    walkthrough of the application so that each participant who
				</li>
				<li>An explanation of the application includes the functions of the application. Without showing how the
				    functions link to each other, explain each possible functions in the application. Also, explain any
				    constraints in the functions available that the users may go through during the task they will need
				    to perform.
				</li>
				<li>Ask the participants who are willing to help test out the application to sign the consent form. This
				    includes explaining what is on the consent form. The consent form for Clarevoyance includes the
				    agreement between the creator and the participants in which the participants will not take the idea
				    which is presented in the prototype and try to create their own version of the application.
				</li>
				<li>For the data that we require, a specific task is explained to the participants. This task is to go
				    through the functions available, find the floorplan function of the application and find the room
				    660 on the ECS floor plan. The users are asked to time themselves for this task. While the users
				    work on the task, the researcher will walk around the class and pick one person to observe and count
				    the amount of clicks they take to get to the goal of the task from the homepage.
				</li>
				<li>After the task was presented to the users, ask the users to fill out the questionnaire that ask the
				    users about how the users feel about the application. These questions includes:
