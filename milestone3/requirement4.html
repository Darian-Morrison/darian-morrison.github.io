				There are 2 choices on the Map: the AR mode, or the traditional map. Both of them navigate the user to
				find the best path from user’s current location, or specified building, to building of their choice to
				meet the requirement 3, 4, and 5 in Phase 1. For the traditional map, the icons are chosen carefully
				based on an assumption that the user has some basic knowledge background that the user can relate to the
				icons such as bullseye and building/structure. The bullseye icon is used to represent the current
				location of the user and the building/structure icon is used to represent the next location that the
				user would like to arrive next. The search bars that are located on the top also contain a text that
				helps explain the user what the information that the application expects. This design in Phase 2 was
				chosen because it is easy and straightforward for the user with different ages to use. The user
				interacts with the traditional map by input the current location and the destination location on the
				screen then the application will show the 3 shortest paths for the user to choose. When the user choose
				the path and click the “Preview Route” button, the excess routes will disappeared and the search bar
				will get replaced by the navigation information to guide the user. If the user would like to use an AR
				mode, the user can click at the “AR Mode” button to switch from traditional map to AR using phone’s
				camera after selecting the route. The arrowhead will appear on the screen and guide the user to the
				destination. If the user would like to switch back to the 2D map, the user can simply click on the “ 2D
				Map” button to return to the map page.
