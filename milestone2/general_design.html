			<h3>Details and Fonts</h3>
			<p>
				For this first application, we’re using the University of Victoria colour brandings as laid out on their
				<a href="https://www.uvic.ca/brand/look-feel/colour/palette/index.php ">website</a>. Ideally, each
				version of the
				application will be developed with individual post secondary institutions, and each version will be
				branded to their colour schemes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The best choices for fonts are the most accessible ones as unofficially defined by the US Department of
				Health & Human Services: Times New Roman, Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, and Calibri. In order to
				achieve continuity with the University of Victoria branding, we’ve chosen to use the Calibri font at a
				minimum of 14 point.
			</p>
			<h3>Conceptual Design</h3>
			<p>The Conceptual Models used in the application design are the map and the AR usage of the camera function
			   of the phone. Other conceptual models are incorporated into this application such as the starting menu
			   consisting of 4 options: search, building directory, directions, and map; the AR mode; and navigation
			   mode. </p>
			<p>The starting menu of the application gives the user 4 options. These 4 options are in the shape of apps
			   similar to those on a normal smartphone home screen. The first option is ”search”: a Search Bar appears,
			   similar to a search engine search bar, allowing the user to search for the building they are trying to
			   find. In this screen, the AR mode can also be accessed to identify the building the user is standing
			   near. The second option on the home screen that the user can choose is the “building” function, this
			   function gives a list of the names of all the UVic buildings. The list, and information is similar to a
			   dictionary application showing the information of the building chosen. From this function, the user can
			   choose directions to or from the selected building, to view the floor plans of the selected building, or
			   view the building on the map. The next option is the “directions” option, this is modeled like the map
			   function of any map application. This option allows the users to input their location, and their
			   destination, after which, the user is shown the way from their location to their destination. The last
			   option that can be reached from the main menu of the application is the “map”. The map shows a general
			   map similar to Google maps, allowing the user to scroll around the map, and choose any buildings they
			   want information on.</p>
			<p>From the building information screen or the map screen, the ability to turn on the AR mode is available.
			   This option is available as a button on the top right of the screen. The AR function uses phone’s camera
			   allowing the the user to angle it at a nearby building and identify which building it is. From the
			   building identification, the user can view the floorplans of the building, the information of the
			   building, get directions from, or return to the previous menu. Additionally, in the directions menu, an
			   AR mode can be activated. Once a starting point, and destination are entered, this AR navigation mode
			   will overlay a universal arrow on the screen pointing in the direction the user is meant to travel to get
			   to their destination.</p>
