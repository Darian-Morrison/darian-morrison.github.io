Several interface metaphors are being utilized: magnifying glass, arrowheads, building/structures, pinpoint, and bullseye. The first icon on the top left of the menu page is a magnifying glass, which indicates a search option for the user to click, and search for a specific building on the map. The second icon, on the top right, is an arrowhead, which indicates the directions that the user would like to obtain by providing his/her location and the destination location. The icon on the bottom left is a building, which indicates that it provides the information relating to buildings. The last icon ,on the bottom right, is a pinpoint on a map, which gives the user an idea where he/she can see  a map. Even though there are text descriptions at the bottom of each icon, these four icons are carefully selected based on their meanings, and an assumption that the user has a basic knowledge to understand the meaning of each icon chosen. On the map page, the first icon is the bullseye, selected to indicate the current location of the user; this is based on an assumption that the user has seen a similar icon before from other map, or transit applications. The next icon is a building icon, selected to represent the destination building that the user would like to arrive at. Because there is not much space left underneath the searching bar, there is we’ve omitted text descriptions underneath the icons; therefore, the icons have been selected as common icons people have in similar  applications. However, to make it easier for all users, there is an explanation, that subsequently disappears when entering text, of what the user needs to input in the searching bars. On the direction page, and in the AR navigation mode, the navigation system uses an arrow icon, which should be easy to understand and follow, as it help guiding the user to the building. Finally, on each of the application pages, save the main menu, a left facing arrow with the text “back” appears to allow the user to quickly return to the previous page.
